# IanZyvithTeamProfileGenerator

## Goal

To use OOP and TDD to create a Team Profile Generation application with Node, Inquierer and Jest. Users will answer a series of prompts and in return get a generated HTML page that displays their desired team.

## Screenshot

This video demonstrates that the application passes all tests and works as intended.
